        Type tests are more elaborate tests and are performed before supplying a type of cable on general commercial basis, in order to demonstrate satisfactory performance characteristics to meet the intended application. These are of such a nature that, after they have been carried out, they need not to be repeated unless changes are made in the cable material or design which might change the performance characteristics. Using the latest testing equipment we carry out a full range of Routine Sample and Type Tests as per national and international standards.
