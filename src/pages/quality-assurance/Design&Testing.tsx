        Type tests are more elaborate tests and are performed before supplying a
        type of cable on general commercial basis, in order to demonstrate
        satisfactory performance characteristics to meet the intended
        application. These are of such a nature that, after they have been
        carried out, they need not to be repeated unless changes are made in the
        cable material or design which might change the performance
        characteristics. Using the latest testing equipment we carry out a full
        range of Routine Sample and Type Tests as per national and international
        standards.
